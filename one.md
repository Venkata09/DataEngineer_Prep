We at StarTree work on some of the hardest challenges in real-time analytics at PB scale.

Anyone who’s ever tackled Upsert in an analytics database knows it’s a tough problem to solve —n ot just for ingesting massive volumes, but for keeping everything fast, consistent, and resilient. And when you’re operating at petabyte scale, one of the biggest operational challenges is how to efficiently restart a system with huge upsert-heavy tables, without long downtime or unpredictable recovery.

Our latest blog (link in the comments) by Chaitanya Deepthi Chadalavada dives deep into the engineering behind scaling Upsert support in Apache Pinot, focusing on the colution to speed up server restarts.

From rebuilding billions of primary keys to leveraging off-heap metadata storage (with RocksDB), persisting intelligent bitmaps, and introducing clever snapshot and persistence logic, StarTree reimagined how operational recovery can work at scale.

If you’re passionate about data systems and love learning how teams evolve real-time analytics infrastructure for reliability and speed, you’ll want to read this one!
More such interesting blogs on the way :)
